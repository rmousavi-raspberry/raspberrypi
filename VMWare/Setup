IF your VM gets stuck on Boot it may be you ran out of disk space:
1. Click CTRL+F1 (of F2) + ALT
2. type df -h in tty (this will show which disk is 100% like /dev/sda3)
3. clean up disk to free up space: sudo apt-get autoclean or sudo apt-get clean
4. Or you may need to re-create VM with larger disk like 100GB
5. Note you should run this disk from a USB with lots of space

If you get an error:
ERROR: could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
Check processes running apt
RUN: ps aux | grep -i apt
Try: sudo killall apt apt-get or sudo kill -9 <process_id>
OR: Ubuntu is likely downloading daily updates - you can disbale this
